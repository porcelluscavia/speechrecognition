# A Comparison of Deep Learning Systems for Phone Recognition
## Abstract
Deep neural networks, which employ nonlinear iterative frameworks to recognize patterns, have emerged in recent years as an ideal basis for automated
speech recognition (ASR) systems. While the research community has proposed numerous models to generate text from speech, error rates for individual phone classification from raw speech data remain relatively high. This
thesis seeks to investigate and improve upon currently available deep learning techniques for phone recognition. Beyond providing the motivation for
this project, this paper describes a broad range of promising research in the
field. Several self-implemented solutions, which had not yet been applied to
phone recognition in the existing literature, are also presented. These CNN-based models trained on MFCC features incorporate Gated Recurrent Units
and two types of transfer learning. The outcomes of the deep learning models
used approach state-of-the-art accuracy on consumer-grade resources for this
complex, multi-label problem.
